I"ï<p>Iâ€™m a senior Ruby on Rails &amp; React engineer at Mon Ami and a former Caring.com and Amazon engineer.</p>

<p>As an aspiring entrepreneur, I co-founded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucq9ioECuQE">Blissity</a> in 2014. The desire was to build a marketplace for social do-gooders who would be incentivised to donate to NGOs.</p>

<p>At present, Iâ€™m trying to follow the 10% Entrepreneur philosophy and build <a href="https://www.organisely.app">Organisely</a> on the side.</p>
