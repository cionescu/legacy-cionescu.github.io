I'm a senior Ruby on Rails & React engineer at Mon Ami and a former Caring.com and Amazon engineer.

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I co-founded [Blissity][blissity] in 2014 to build a marketplace for social do-gooders who would be incentivised to donate to NGOs.

In 2018, I co-founded [Organisely][organisely] to build a modern CRM for Dental Practices and Beauty Salons looking to improve their appointment management.

In 2020, I co-founded [SEOly][seoly] to build the most affordable SEO tool for Small Businesses and Agencies.
