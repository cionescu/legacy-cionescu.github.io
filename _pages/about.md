I'm a senior Ruby on Rails & React engineer at Mon Ami and a former Caring.com and Amazon engineer.

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I co-founded [Blissity][blissity] in 2014. The desire was to build a marketplace for social do-gooders who would be incentivised to donate to NGOs.

At present, I'm trying to follow the 10% Entrepreneur philosophy and build [Organisely][organisely] on the side.
